# redux-toolkit
  * Redux is a global state
  * Redux is not necessary for every project.
  * You may need Redux if you don't want to do props drilling (passing props too deep).
  * If you are still confused about Redux, just think about the React state. The only difference is you can access the state from anywhere.
```bash
  Just remember that concept "get" and "set". In Redux, we can think that "get" is a selector, and "set" is a dispatch
```
